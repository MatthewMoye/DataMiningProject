# Group Project for Data Mining (CPSC 8650, Spring 2021)

Our Project deals with implementing different Machine Learning Methods to try and see what accuracies can be achieved and which Method achieves the highest accuracy.

### Dataset
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

This dataset contains 60,000 images, broken up into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000. Each image fits into one of ten categories of various objects or things (for example, a cat, an airplane, etc.). The training set contains 6,000 images per category.

### Methods
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine (radial basis function)
- Convolutional Neural Network

### Group Members
- Jacob Stauch
- Matthew Moye
- Nolan Corbet
